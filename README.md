# OBOR-Public-Sphere

The diplomatic speeches can be viewed as the signal the government sends to the *international* community. Meanwhile, the news articles, when strictly censored, are often seen as the message that the government wants the *domestic* community to perceive. If such interpretation is indeed accurate, then these two sources should have similar trends of discussing certain topics over time. Furthermore, we can expect the newspapers to react to the change in tactics from the officials, and modify their coverage strategy accordingly. Is such an argument true

In this paper, we used Structural Topic Models (Roberts 2014) to capture the change in the attention on the `One Belt, One Road' (OBOR) initiative in the Chinese official diplomatic speeches and newspapers. Our analysis suggests that in the official speeches, the mentions of the OBOR generally fluctuated after its launch. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that the trends of spotlights on OBOR are different in the official speeches and the news.
